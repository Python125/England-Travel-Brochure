# The-DOM-and-JavaScript-in-the-UK

Here's a neat project giving me a chance to continue to flex my programming muscles using HTML, CSS, and JS, while getting some experience with the DOM.Â It allowed me to experiment with various dynamic web elements, creating interactive visual effects that enhance the user experience. Inspired by my travels to Great Britain, I've implemented a captivating hero image animation that shrinks upon scrolling, and a visually appealing text and image entry animation that slides onto the screen.

This project marked my initial foray into DOM manipulation. I was fascinated by the ability to dynamically alter a webpage's elements. Experimenting with techniques like creating a shrinking hero image and animated text containers significantly enhanced my understanding of JavaScript's power to transform static HTML into interactive experiences.
