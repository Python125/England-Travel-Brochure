# JavaScript-Travel-Brochure

This project was an opportunity to experiment with the core building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By building this project, I focused on creating interactive visual effects that enhance the user experience. I've implemented two key JavaScript functionalities: a captivating hero image animation that shrinks upon scrolling, and a visually appealing text and image entry animation. This project allowed me to refine my understanding of how to manipulate the DOM and create engaging user interactions.
