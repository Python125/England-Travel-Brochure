# JavaScript-Travel-Brochure

As a budding front-end developer eager to expand my skill set, I created this project to experiment with dynamic web elements. By utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I focused on creating interactive visual effects that enhance the user experience. I've implemented two key JavaScript functionalities: a captivating hero image animation that shrinks upon scrolling, and a visually appealing text and image entry animation. This project allowed me to refine my understanding of how to manipulate the DOM and create engaging user interactions.
